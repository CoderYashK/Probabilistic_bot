# Probabilistic_bot
Basically this was a part of my second year college project in Principles of Programming Languages Course. Where, I developed
a Prediction_bot which predicts the Question's Tag and the probability that the question lies under that particular tag. It 
uses a local database written in json format which can be updated as per the need.
